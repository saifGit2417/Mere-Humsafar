                <p>A 19-year-old running for public office in New Hampshire found out about the importance of following
                    Internet safety rules the hard way. As Seacoast Online reports, his opponents found images in his social
                    media posts that were sexually suggestive and referenced past drug use. Just like that, his political
                    career crashed and burned upon takeoff. But, unfortunately, he isn't the only one, as careless Internet
                    habits have left others exposed to scams, identity theft and physical harm at the hands of people they
                    met online. With more users accessing the Internet through mobile devices, these risks are changing and
                    growing quickly.

                    Even though apps loom larger in most people's daily online interactions than traditional websites do,
                    that does not mean that the basic Internet safety rules have changed. Hackers are still on the lookout
                    for personal information they can use to access your credit card and bank information.

                    Unsafe surfing can also lead to other threats—from embarrassing personal comments or images that, once
                    online, are nearly impossible to erase, to getting mixed up with people you'd rather have had nothing to
                    do with.

                    Here are the Top 10 Internet safety rules to follow to help you avoid getting into trouble online (and
                    offline).</p>
                <ol>
                    <li class="onlinesafetytext"> Keep Personal Information Professional and Limited</li>
                    <p>Potential employers or customers don't need to know your personal relationship status or your home
                        address. They do need to know about your expertise and professional background, and how to get in
                        touch with you. You wouldn't hand purely personal information out to strangers individually—don't
                        hand it out to millions of people online.</p>
                    <li class="onlinesafetytext">Keep Your Privacy Settings On</li>
                    <p>Marketers love to know all about you, and so do hackers. Both can learn a lot from your browsing and
                        social media usage. But you can take charge of your information. As noted by Lifehacker, both web
                        browsers and mobile operating systems have settings available to protect your privacy online. Major
                        websites like Facebook also have privacy-enhancing settings available. These settings are sometimes
                        (deliberately) hard to find because companies want your personal information for its marketing
                        value. Make sure you have enabled these privacy safeguards, and keep them enabled.</p>
                    <li class="onlinesafetytext">Practice Safe Browsing</li>
                    <p>You wouldn't choose to walk through a dangerous neighborhood—don't visit dangerous neighborhoods
                        online. Cybercriminals use lurid content as bait. They know people are sometimes tempted by dubious
                        content and may let their guard down when searching for it. The Internet's demimonde is filled with
                        hard-to-see pitfalls, where one careless click could expose personal data or infect your device with
                        malware. By resisting the urge, you don't even give the hackers a chance.</p>
                    <li class="onlinesafetytext">Make Sure Your Internet Connection is Secure. Use a Secure VPN Connection
                    </li>
                    <p>When you go online in a public place, for example by using a public Wi-Fi connection, PCMag notes you
                        have no direct control over its security. Corporate cybersecurity experts worry about
                        "endpoints"—the places where a private network connects to the outside world. Your vulnerable
                        endpoint is your local Internet connection. Make sure your device is secure, and when in doubt, wait
                        for a better time (i.e., until you're able to connect to a secure Wi-Fi network) before providing
                        information such as your bank account number.

                        To further improve your Internet browsing safety, use secure VPN connection (virtual private network
                        ). VPN enables you to have a secure connection between your device and an Internet server that no
                        one can monitor or access the data that you’re exchanging. Read more about What is VPN</p>
                    <li class="onlinesafetytext">Be Careful What You Download</li>
                    <p>A top goal of cybercriminals is to trick you into downloading malware—programs or apps that carry
                        malware or try to steal information. This malware can be disguised as an app: anything from a
                        popular game to something that checks traffic or the weather. As PCWorld advises, don't download
                        apps that look suspicious or come from a site you don't trust.</p>
                    <li class="onlinesafetytext">Choose Strong Passwords</li>
                    <p>Passwords are one of the biggest weak spots in the whole Internet security structure, but there's
                        currently no way around them. And the problem with passwords is that people tend to choose easy ones
                        to remember (such as "password" and "123456"), which are also easy for cyber thieves to guess.
                        Select strong passwords that are harder for cybercriminals to demystify. Password manager software
                        can help you to manage multiple passwords so that you don't forget them. A strong password is one
                        that is unique and complex—at least 15 characters long, mixing letters, numbers and special
                        characters.</p>
                    <li class="onlinesafetytext">Make Online Purchases From Secure Sites</li>
                    <p>Any time you make a purchase online, you need to provide credit card or bank account information—just
                        what cybercriminals are most eager to get their hands on. Only supply this information to sites that
                        provide secure, encrypted connections. As Boston University notes, you can identify secure sites by
                        looking for an address that starts with https: (the S stands for secure) rather than simply http:
                        They may also be marked by a padlock icon next to the address bar.</p>
                    <li class="onlinesafetytext">Be Careful What You Post</li>
                    <p>The Internet does not have a delete key, as that young candidate in New Hampshire found out. Any
                        comment or image you post online may stay online forever because removing the original (say, from
                        Twitter) does not remove any copies that other people made. There is no way for you to "take back" a
                        remark you wish you hadn't made, or get rid of that embarrassing selfie you took at a party. Don't
                        put anything online that you wouldn't want your mom or a prospective employer to see.</p>
                    <li class="onlinesafetytext"> Be Careful Who You Meet Online</li>
                    <p>People you meet online are not always who they claim to be. Indeed, they may not even be real. As
                        InfoWorld reports, fake social media profiles are a popular way for hackers to cozy up to unwary Web
                        users and pick their cyber pockets. Be as cautious and sensible in your online social life as you
                        are in your in-person social life</p>
                    <li class="onlinesafetytext"> Keep Your Antivirus Program Up To Date</li>
                    <p>Internet security software cannot protect against every threat, but it will detect and remove most
                        malware—though you should make sure it's to date. Be sure to stay current with your operating
                        system's updates and updates to applications you use. They provide a vital layer of security.

                        Keep these 10 basic Internet safety rules in mind and you'll avoid many of the nasty surprises that
                        lurk online for the careless.</p>
